# Real-Time-LED-Control-System-Using-Simulator
The Real-Time LED Control System in Tinkercad simulates Arduino with red and green LEDs controlled by buttons (pins 2 and 3). Interrupts switch LED blink rates (1-2 Hz) and colors. Demonstrates embedded systems basics: pin setup, interrupts, real-time control in Tinkercad.
